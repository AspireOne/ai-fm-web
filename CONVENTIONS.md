# A Remix web app

## UI

- Use NextUI components, colors etc. (just import them from "@heroui/react", they renamed themselves)
  to build the UI where possible.
- For other cases, use Tailwind css.
- Try to write clean code and break components down into smaller parts (tightly coupled components can be in the same
  file)
- Use React Hook Form, Tanstack Query, sonner (Toasts), axios (/providers/api.ts, which already has a pre-defined
  baseURL for backend)
